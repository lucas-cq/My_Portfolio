## The Process
This was a great project and I really enjoyed putting it together. From learning Vue functions to Greensock animations. My favorite part was finally being able to make a website the way I wanted to, as previously I did not possess the skills to. This is the end result of a code noob after 6 months in a web development program. I doubted myself so much through this program not thinking it was for me. I was very wrong and regret even worrying about that. My story has just begun however, and I still have loads to learn. I am excited to see what this industry has in store for me. A huge thanks to Tony and Ash for delivering a great program and always being there to help.
